# Phoenix Grasser's MAGD 150 Project Highlights  
  
Some examples of projects I created during the Spring 2021 semester  
  
## Colorful Bubbles  
  
Simple mouse interaction and some console output with a design inspired by visuals used on TV channels that functioned as radios.

## TV Channels  
  
Testing with some animation and restricting where something can go to keep objects inside of a frame, as well as some interactivity.

## Flowers  
  
Practice with objects and user defined classes; yet again more interactivity. Some random generation for the color and number of petals on each flower, as well as making sure the angles worked to fit all the petals around the base of the flower.

## Cat Movie Movie Poster  
  
Text and image work; adding custom fonts, applying filters, etc. Using arrays to shuffle between text at the bottom as well.
